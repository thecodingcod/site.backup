# A Manageable Stress

I guess you're here trying to find the ultimate solution for your stress level which was hitting the sky the last few hours, days or weeks. Well, I'm sorry that you're feeling so. but there is no "ultimate solution", it's a natural reaction and a biological alarm that tells you that something is going wrong. but sometimes it exceeds the limits, that's where we should find a way to reduce it. or keep it at a manageable level.  
  
To be honest, I won't promise much. I myself still have higher levels of stress recently feeling overwhelmed, and having a heavy mind with a loaded schedule and personal plans that I barely achieve any progress with, perhaps it's the case for you too.

The purpose of this article is to present a method that worked for me from time to time with a bit of awareness about what stress is, and what it looks like, If you're not interested so far, I understand. Don't waste your time, but you'll remain stressed though.

## What the heck is that devil?

According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/stress), Stress can be defined as:

> a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. <mark>Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives.</mark> Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.

As mentioned before, it's like an alarm that warns about possible threats and it was naturally developed for humans to protect themselves in forests from more hostile animals approaching their camp. But, here is the funny-sad fact, you're almost a nerd sitting in front of your laptop or holding your phone reading this article in a fortified city with no single physical threat. Well, if you think so, you're wrong! in the modern world, you're a victim of more mental illness perhaps for financial reasons, career growth issues, or maybe your ambitions are above the sky and you can barely cope with achieving it.

## It's Not the Devil

Aside from the fact that you hate this feeling, Stress is like the fuel that keeps you going forward, from that tiny activity of wearing your clothes to the biggest challenge that you might be in the middle of right now.

Stress is a reaction to a certain fear and other emotions that causes fear, and it always has a reason backing its existence. For example, you're wearing your clothes because deep inside you there is a fear of being judged by society if you were spotted naked. After all, it's against their standard (if you disagree with this, please let me know where you live).

Or maybe, the last valentine was so horrible for you (I'm sorry to hear that, valentine is a lame idea to me, express your love every day at every chance). Anyway, now you're here stressed not just because you're suffering from oxytocin withdrawal but because you have a fear of being on your own again with no close one to share your boring events and to celebrate an achievement, ... love is more than that though (not our topic here Mr. Valentino)

The only way to get almost zero-stress levels is to get drunk, and you'll be just a junkie who wanders without a reason. (It's a good feeling though, but I wouldn't recommend it)

Stick to stress it's trying to help you. but help sometimes comes with a cost.

## Symptoms of Over-stress

Well, there is a wide variety of stress symptoms but let's the most important ones from my point of view (I'm the author, and I have the right to do so)

* **Sleeping issues**, or maybe you can barely sleep for a continuous 4 hours a day.
    
* **Headache**, It's not the major issue though, a <s>paracetamol pill</s> can help with it temporarily or just a cup of coffee (that will raise your stress level btw. Idc, I love coffee). Kidding, **It's an ugly symptom.**
    
* **Trying to accelerate the time,** you think that if the time passes everything will be fine, but come on, lying on your couch for a day waiting for a time to pass won't do any difference.
    
* An **Increased heart rate**, **depression** and **anxiety**.
    
* Barely be able to concentrate
    

And a lot more symptoms, but since this platform is tech-oriented these symptoms will prevent you from being in your best productive mood.

## One Of The ways I manage it

There are many factors to manage your stress, with a lot of biological metrics to maintain, some of them are mentioned [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/stress) but during wandering in my thoughts I came up with a way (perhaps someone else has mentioned that idk and IDC, would be just a coincidence), anyway let's answer few questions which require you to be honest with yourself and have your own space (there is nothing to be afraid of, It's you to you).

### Assumption

* Stress has reasons for fear
    
* Each reason has a root cause
    
* Resolving **controllable** root cause issues might get your stress to fade away which in turn will reduce it, so Actions are needed here.
    

### Application

Now Let's answer a few questions that might help you to clarify the root cause of your stress:

#### **Begin by listing your fears**

* I'm afraid of getting fired
    

#### **Why do you think so?**

* My boss was treating me like shit recently
    
* My colleagues are avoiding me
    
* ...
    

#### Is there any supporting evidence for your claims?

this one is quite an important step, where you'll validate your claims. because claims remain claims and maybe you've misinterpreted the whole thing. so a repetitive act might confirm a certain claim, but it won't be certain though! or maybe you've done something wrong that causes someone to treat you like this, that's the point where you need to be honest with yourself.

* &lt;I don't have any evidence for an imaginary scenario, I'll leave it for you&gt;
    

#### Actions

Now, analyzing would be a waste of time without deciding on an action that you think might resolve the issue, At this point, there are two kinds of people:

* Those who don't mind risky actions (that certainly don't include any kind of violence), I've no advice for you (clearly, I'm not a therapist) but maybe sticking to manners and logical decisions would help when dealing with uncertainty, also emotional-intelligence and picking the right time is a trivial factor in-case of dealing with people.
    
* Those who prefer the safe shelter (don't pick risky actions, you already have enough stress to deal with. if the safe one is to remain silent and it's bearable then, do it) otherwise, please take the risk for just a single time in your whole life-time span, Life it's too fucking short to be like a statue.
    

Now, nothing is left but to **TAKE THESE ACTIONS**, after being reviewed carefully. throw your coin and I'll wish you luck.

## Unmanageable Reasons

Well, I don't have something for you to try today. but at least you've eliminated the manageable ones, which might reduce the stress levels.

I won't promise any results though, every reason has its weight of causing stress, and the biggest stress cause might be uncontrollable already. which is the fact for most of us and it's very sad. Pain is inevitable brother. but I wish everything will be fine for you shortly. and remember what **Marcus Aurelius** said for such occasions:

> “It’s unfortunate that this has happened. No. Fortunately, this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it.”

## Last word

<mark>Consider visiting a therapist.</mark>

No, more words I'll leave you with this song by **Bobby McFerrin**
