Hi there âœ‹, I'm Mohamed Halawa a **Fullstack web developer** from Egypt. I use the web trinity **HTML**, **CSS **and **JavaScript** along with the **.NET** stack on a daily basis to **develop websites** though I'm not loyal to the .NET Stack as I'm considering myself a **language-agnostic**.

Recently I've used python and I actually liked the level of abstraction it provides that made everything easy for me to accomplish without bothering about the low-level details!

## What am I going to write about? 

Well, I write to help others and to share my thoughts with the public. however, that doesn't answer the question so I'll try to mention some of the most interesting topics for me that I'll be writing about:
- Techincal related topics (sure you knew it!)
- Software design-related topics (OOAD, Design Patterns and Architecture)
- Tips & Tricks that I find important and deserves a share!
- Solutions for the problems I solve on various problem-solving platforms
- Reads & Reviews on them even summaries for those I think to be interesting
- Philosophical Talks from time to time!
